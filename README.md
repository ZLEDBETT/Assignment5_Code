Essentially, this project simulates an online shopping cart. Amazon holds various item types, prices, names, etc, and 
interacts with a database. It also implements various calculations for pricing, delivery, and extra charges.
Barnes and Noble is a little more watered down, but still holds a lot of the same key elements. It contains a 
book database and a way to check to see if a book is in stock. 

The Barnes and Noble tests verifies that the book purchasing process adheres to the logic and ensure that the
classes are all connected. The Amazon unit tests ensures that each calculation works correctly. The integration
test makes sure that everything works seamlessly together and that no conflicts arise. 

All tests passed and a Jacoco and Checkstyle report was produced.
